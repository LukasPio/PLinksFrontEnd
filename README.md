A simple and not very pretty front-end for PLinks that is my implementation of a link shortener in java + spring: https://github.com/LukasPio/PLinks

I didn't focus too much on elegance and stylization, just on usuability.

The sole purpose of this repository is to allow testing of my API as a final product, without the need for an external http client.
